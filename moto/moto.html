    <p>Once, there was a man named Raj who had always dreamed of owning a vintage car. After years of saving, he finally bought a stunning 1967 Mustang GT—a rare find in mint condition. Raj poured his heart into restoring every detail, from the leather seats to the powerful V8 engine. He loved driving it on weekends, cruising the empty highways at dawn, feeling the thrill of the classic muscle car’s rumble.

        One day, while taking the car out for a drive, Raj noticed an elderly man waving him down by the side of the road. He pulled over, and the man looked at the Mustang in awe. He introduced himself as John and shared that he’d once owned the exact same model—same color, same year—but had to sell it during a difficult time.
